# Homophily-driven community detection on attributed networks


**Background Study**

Homophily-driven community detection is a community detection strategy that relies on the homophily principle, which argues that people are more likely to associate with others who share similar characteristics. This paper proposes a novel approach for community detection on attributed networks leveraging the concept of homophily, nodes with similar attributes tend to connect more strongly. By using topological and homophily properties, we try to bridge the gap between the network topology and the attribute information. 
Homophily, the tendency of similar nodes to be grouped together plays a crucial role in community detection. This is particularly useful in attributed networks where nodes contain attributes that include personal interest, demographics, and behavior.
Machine learning techniques have been widely applied to detect communities in distributed networks, yielding promising results in capturing structural and attribute-based homophily.
